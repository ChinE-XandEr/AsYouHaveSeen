# AsYouHaveSeen

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Why I Make It

I created this project to build a platform for managing all the projects I am promoting and going to start.
In fact, the inspire of this project is from Honkai: Star Rail, As I've Written.
By the way, this project is informal and for testing purposes, so I had never expected it to be very useful for my future work.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).
